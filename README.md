# Problem Statement:
Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the complexity and volatility of financial markets. Investors and traders require accurate predictions to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks. However, traditional forecasting methods often fall short in capturing the intricate patterns and dynamics of stock prices. Therefore, there is a need for an effective and reliable prediction model that can leverage historical stock data and advanced machine learning techniques to accurately forecast future stock prices.

# Objectives:
The problem at hand is to develop a stock prediction system using the Yahoo Finance API and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The objective is to create a model that can learn from historical stock data and make accurate predictions of future stock prices. The system should provide reliable and actionable insights to assist investors, traders, and financial analysts in making informed decisions in the stock market.

# Methods used:
* Data Visualization.
* Deep Learning.

# Libraries utilized:
* NumPy and Pandas - For dataset cleaning and analysis.
* Matplotlib, Plotly and Seaborn - For Data Visualization.
* SkLearn - For scaling and performance measure.
* LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)

# Project Overview:
Stock prediction is a challenging task that involves forecasting the future prices of a given stock based on historical data. In recent years, the integration of machine learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, has shown promising results in accurately predicting stock prices. This summary outlines the process of stock prediction using the Yahoo Finance API and LSTM.

The first step in the stock prediction process is gathering historical stock price data. The Yahoo Finance API provides a convenient and reliable source of historical stock data for various financial instruments. By using this API, one can collect a significant amount of historical data, including the opening and closing prices, trading volume, and other relevant metrics.

Once the data is collected, the next step is to preprocess and prepare it for training the LSTM model. This involves normalizing the data to a common scale, dividing it into training and testing sets, and formatting it into a suitable input format for the LSTM network. The LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective at capturing sequential patterns and dependencies in time series data.

The LSTM model is then trained using the training dataset, where it learns to recognize patterns and relationships between historical stock prices and their corresponding future movements. The model's training process involves adjusting its internal weights and biases based on a defined loss function, which measures the disparity between predicted and actual stock prices. This iterative optimization process continues until the model achieves satisfactory performance on the training data.

After training, the LSTM model is evaluated using the testing dataset to assess its predictive accuracy. The model's performance is measured using various evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data and indicates its potential to predict future stock prices accurately.

Finally, with the trained LSTM model, stock price prediction can be performed on new, unseen data. By inputting historical data into the model, it generates predictions for future stock prices. These predictions can assist investors, traders, and financial analysts in making informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding stocks.

In summary, the combination of the Yahoo Finance API and LSTM neural networks presents a powerful approach for stock price prediction. By leveraging historical stock data and the capabilities of LSTM networks, this method can provide valuable insights and support decision-making in the dynamic world of stock markets.
